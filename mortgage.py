# Exercise 1.7
# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of 
# $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin 
# trading corporation. The interest rate is 5% and the monthly 
# payment is $2684.11.
# Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave 
# will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:


initial = 500000
monthly = 2684.11
interest = 0.05

total_paid = 0.0

while initial > 0:
    initial = initial * (1+interest/12) - monthly
    total_paid = total_paid + monthly

print('Total paid', total_paid)

# Suppose Dave pays an extra $1000/month for the first 12 months of the mortgage?
# Modify the program to incorporate this extra payment and have it print the total 
# amount paid along with the number of months required.

    total_paid = total_paid + monthly
    month += 1

        initial = initial - extra_payment
        total_paid = total_paid + extra_payment
    print(month, round(total_paid,2), round(initial,2))

# for 4 years starting after the first five years have already been paid?

# total paid so far, and the remaining balance. Make sure,
# there is no overpayment in the end.

# Header for the table

# Loop until the loan is paid off
while initial > 0:

    # Calculate interest for the month
    interest_for_month = initial * (interest / 12)
