def portfolio_cost(filename):

    Computes the total cost (shares*price) of a portfolio file
    '''
    total_cost = 0.0

# Using this code as a rough guide, create a new 
# file report.py. In that file, define a function 
# read_portfolio(filename) that opens a given portfolio 
# file and reads it into a list of tuples. 

# make a variable thatâ€™s initially set to an empty list

# turn each row into a tuple and append it to the list

# now modify the function to represent each stock in the portfolio with a dictionary 
# instead of a tuple. In this dictionary use the field names of "name", 
# "shares", and "price" to represent the different columns in the input file.
